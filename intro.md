Overview
========
Tensor networks represent a collection of methods and algorithms to study complex interacting systems. Originally invented in the quantum information science to provide a flexible description of quantum states, tensor networks techniques quickly found their way to other disciplines.

This book provides a hands-on experience to the field of tensor network methods with applications to quantum information science and machine learning. Hope, you enjoy it!
