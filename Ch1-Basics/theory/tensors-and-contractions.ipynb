Similarly, a linear operator $A : \\mathcal X \\rightarrow \\mathcal X$ is a $2$nd order tensor with a representation in the chosen computational basis as $\\sum^{d-1}_{i,j=0}A_{ij} | i \\rangle \\langle j |$ with components $A_{ij} = \\langle i|A|j \\rangle$."

    "A tensor _order_ (or _valence_) is used to indicate a total number of indices required to specify individual elements of a tensor. As such, a vector is tensor of order $1$, and a matrix is a tensor of order $2$. A trivial tensor of order $0$ is a scalar. It is a good practice to always use the word order to distinguish various types of tensors.\n",
